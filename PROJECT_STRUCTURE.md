## 🎯 **Clean Project Benefits**

✅ **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer files to maintain  
✅ **Clear Structure**: Obvious file purposes and organization  
✅ **No Duplication**: Single source of truth for each feature  
✅ **Professional Layout**: Standard Python package structure  
✅ **Easy Navigation**: Logical grouping of related functionality  

## 🚀 **Usage**

The cleaned up project now has a clear entry point:

```bash
# Main application
python file_organizer_cli.py

# Or use shortcuts
.\file-organizer.bat          # Windows batch
.\file-organizer.ps1          # PowerShell

# Installation
python install.py

# Testing
python enhanced_test_suite.py

# Demo
python demo_cli.py
```

This clean structure makes the project more maintainable, professional, and easier to understand for new users and contributors.
